# XTrack  

**XTrack** is a simple and practical tool I created to streamline the process of working with AI-separated instrument tracks. As a drummer, I often work with tracks where the drums are removed and the bass guitar is enhanced. XTrack allows me to quickly combine these separated instruments into a single, cohesive track. The application can be used for any instrument.

## Key Features  
- **Channel Management**: Organize and adjust separated instrument tracks.  
- **Quick Equalizer Options**: The simple equalizer options provide just enough control for quick adjustments.  
- **Fast and Efficient**: Designed for speed and simplicity to keep the workflow smooth and hassle-free.  
- **Lightweight**: Focused on functionality without unnecessary complexity.
