XTrack
XTrack is a simple and practical tool I created to streamline the process of working with AI-separated instrument tracks. As a drummer, I often work with tracks where the drums are isolated, and the bass guitar is enhanced. XTrack allows me to quickly combine these separated instruments into a single, cohesive track.

Key Features
Channel Management: Organize and adjust separated instrument tracks, such as drums, bass, and more.
Quick Equalizer Options: While not overly detailed, the built-in equalizer options provide just enough control for quick adjustments.
Fast and Efficient: Designed for speed and simplicity to keep the workflow smooth and hassle-free.
Lightweight: Focused on functionality without unnecessary complexity.
XTrack was built for personal use, tailored to meet my need for a straightforward tool to process and merge tracks. It’s not about complex sound design—just a practical solution for combining and exporting music efficiently.
